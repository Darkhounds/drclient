WIP (Not even an alpha)

Requires node.js to be installed!

Run 'npm install' before trying to run anything else! (this will take some time when run for the first time!)

---

Run 'node src/server/cli.js game username password character' to connect with the game though the command line.

---

Run 'npm run bundle' to create a node-webkit application under build/drclient/[OS]/[drclient.exe|drclient.app|drclient]

---

It's possible to type 'node src/server/proxy' to serve on localhost:3010 which will be consumed by launching src/index.html on a Web Browser
